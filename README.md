# Toki dashboard for Toggl

Cute dashboard to track your velocity. It pulls data from Toggl and works fully in browser. Check it out here: [toki.sinja.io](https://toki.sinja.io/).

To use it you will need Toggle API key (find it [here](https://track.toggl.com/profile)) and also to switch 'visibility' of projects you wan't to display to public.
